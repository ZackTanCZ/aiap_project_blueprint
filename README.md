# Project Title & Description
Begin with the title of your project and a brief description of what it does. This section should provide a high-level overview of your project's purpose and functionality.

# Prerequisites and Installation
List any prerequisites needed to run the project, such as Python version, libraries, and other dependencies. Include instructions on how to set up the environment and install the necessary packages. This is where your 'requirements.txt' file will come in handy.

# Instructions for Executing the Pipeline
Provide step-by-step instructions for running your end-to-end machine learning pipeline. Include details on how to execute the 'main.py' script and any other relevant scripts. Additionally, explain how to modify any parameters in the 'config.yaml' file if needed.

# Description of Logical Steps/Flow of the Pipeline
Describe the logical steps and flow of your machine learning pipeline. Include a brief explanation of each major step, such as data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. If useful, include flow charts or other visual aids to help illustrate the process.

# Overview of Key Findings from EDA
Summarise the key findings from your exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted in the previous sections. Highlight any important patterns, trends, or insights that influenced the design of your pipeline. Keep the detailed EDA in the Jupyter notebook, and include only a quick summary in the 'README.md'.

# Feature Handling Description
Provide a description of how the features in the dataset are cleaned and processed. Include other relevant information such as any newly engineered features and selected features used in model training. Summarise this information in a table for clarity.

# Explanation of Model Choices
Explain your choice of models for each machine learning task. Discuss why you selected each model and how it fits the specific requirements of your project.

# Evaluation of Models
Evaluate the models you developed, discussing their performance metrics. Explain any metrics used in the evaluation and why they were chosen. This section should provide a clear understanding of how well each model performs.

# Considerations for Deployment
Discuss any additional considerations for deploying the models you developed. This could include scalability, real-time performance, integration with other systems, or any other relevant factors that need to be addressed before deploying the model to production.
